This is a Python script that can be used to deploy new versions of Stratus
applications. It works with Python 3, Python 2 versions are not supported.
Change the Python paths if needed.

Use at your on risk and make sure you are uploading to the correct 
environment. Error handling should be improved yet. There is
conf.py file where you can set your environment specific paths and other
parameters. There are different ways how you can use this:
1)To deploy new code on only one node in the specified colocation (you 
will be provided with the selected IP and name of the host in the beginning
of chef run)
2)To deploy new code on all servers in the specified colocation
3)To deploy new code on all environments, on all servers for that application

In the third case the script does not ask you for verification to proceed 
with chef update, chef run etc. In the first two cases, it does. 

USAGE 
python codeupdate.py <app name> <new version> <env_file file>

EXAMPLES
python codeupdate.py app.name 1.17~20130401110213 all
python codeupdate.py app.name 1.17~20130401110213 prodenv1.rb

FILES
chef_update.py - manages environment upload and update of chef nodes
codeupdate.py - main file which calls out the rest of the modules
conf.py - your configuration parameters
git_handler.py - runs git pull, commits changes and pushes them out to master
versionupdate.py - modifies Chef environment files and replaces version
